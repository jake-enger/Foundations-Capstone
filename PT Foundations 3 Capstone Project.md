PT Foundations 3 Capstone Project


My goal for this project is to create a basic Type Chart for 10 selected Pokemon. 
I plan to have each selected pokemon display almost like a Pokemon card, with the HP,
Pokedex number, the sprite for the pokemon, along with the name, and an icon or text 
displaying the type of the pokemon, and I will do the same for 2 different pokemon, 
one being what the selected Pokemon is weak against, and the other being what the Selected Pokemon is strong against. 

I will be using my original team of six Pokemon from Generation 3, and for the remaining four, I will be taking from the Rival character.

My Team                                     Rival
1. Blaziken  (Fire/Fight)                   1. Swellow    (Normal/Flying)
2. Shedinja  (Bug/Ghost)                    2. Shroomish  (Grass)
3. Kyogre    (Water)                        3. Numel      (Fire/Ground)
4. Latias    (Dragon/Psychic)               4. Marshtomp  (Water/Ground)
5. Megagross (Steel/Psychic)
6. Rayquaza  (Dragon/Flying)

To get the proper type match ups, I will be using a match up chart - which I have included along with the wireframe for this project that will be pushed to Github.
